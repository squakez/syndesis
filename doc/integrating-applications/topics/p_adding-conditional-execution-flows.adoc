= Adding conditional execution flows

During integration development, you can add a *Conditional Flows* 
step to a flow and define one or more conditions. For each condition, 
you add steps to the conditional flow that the integration executes 
when that condition evaluates to true. During integration execution, 
for each message that the previous integration step passes to the 
*Conditional Flows* step, the *Conditional Flows* step  
evaluates the message content against the specified conditions. 
If a condition evaluates to true, the integration executes the 
conditional flow that is associated with that condition.   

For example, consider an integration that connects to a SQL database to 
obtain employee paid-time-off (PTO) data. The returned data indicates:

* Some employees might lose PTO if they do not use it by a certain date.
* Other employees already used more PTO than they earned.
* The rest of the employees have PTO that they can use without time restrictions. 

In a *Conditional Flows* step, this example integration can define two 
conditions as well as a conditional execution flow for each condition:

* When PTO is greater than some number, it indicates that some PTO 
might be lost if not used by a certain date. The integration executes 
a flow that sends email to affected employees. The email contains the 
amount of PTO that must be used and the date by which it must
be used. 

* When PTO is a negative number, it indicates that some PTO has been 
used but not earned. The integration executes a flow that sends 
an email to affected employees. The email contains the amount of PTO that the
employee has overdrawn and specifies the date on which the employee begins
to accrue PTO again. 

In addition, this integration can have a default conditional flow that 
the integration executes for input that does not satisfy either of these 
conditions. This example integration executes the default conditional flow for 
employees whose PTO is neither a negative number nor above some specified number. 
This flow sends an email to those employees with a statement of the 
amount of PTO that the employee has. 

.Prerequisites

* You are creating or editing a primary flow. If this is a simple integration, 
the start and finish connections have been added. You cannot add a 
*Conditional Flows* step to a conditional flow. 
* Input to a *Conditional Flows* step
must be an individual message. In the integration visualization, 
if the previous step's *Data Type* shows *(Collection)*, add a *Split* step. 
* You are familiar with the fields that will be in the messages that the 
integration passes to the *Conditional Flows* step you are about to add.  
* You are familiar with the 
http://camel.apache.org/simple.html[Camel Simple Expression] language
or someone has provided you with expressions for the 
conditions that you want to evaluate. 
* You created each connection that you want to add to a conditional flow. 

.Procedure

. In the integration visualization, where you want to add a *Conditional Flows* step,
click image:images/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[title='plus sign'].
. Click *Conditional Flows*.
. In the *Configure Conditional Flows* page, define one or more conditions: 
.. In the initial *When* field, enter a Camel Simple Expression. For example, 
the following expression evaluates to true when the body of the message
contains a `pto` field that is greater than `160`:
+
`${body.pto} > 160`
+
When this expression evaluates to true, the integration executes the 
conditional flow that you create and associate with this condition. 

.. Optionally, click *Add another condition*, and repeat the previous 
step. Do this for each additional condition that you want to define.

.. Optionally, change the order in which the integration evaluates
the defined conditions by clicking the up or down arrow to the right of a 
condition field. 
 
.. Optionally, click *Use a default flow*.
+
If none of the specified conditions evaluate to true, the integration 
executes the conditional flow that you create as the default conditional 
flow. 

.. Click *Apply* to display a list of the conditions that you defined. 
.. Click *Done* to display the primary flow with a new *Flows* navigation 
control at the top. 

. Define a flow for each condition: 
.. In the *Flows* navigation control, click the down-caret to see an 
entry for each condition that you defined. 
.. Click the condition whose flow you want to create. When this 
condition evaluates to true, the integration executes the flow that
you are about to create. 
+
After you click a condition, {prodname} displays that condition near 
the top of the flow visualization, which shows the *Flow Start* and 
*Flow End* steps that all conditional flows have. You can now edit
this conditional flow. 

.. In the flow visualization, click 
image:images/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[title='plus sign'] to 
add a step to this conditional flow. 

.. Click the step that you want to add. You can add any connection or 
step that you can add to a primary flow.  
+
The output from the *Flow Start* step is always the same as the 
output from the primary flow step that is before this *Conditional Flows* step. 
For example, if you add a filter step or a data mapper step to this 
conditional flow, the available fields are the same fields 
that would be available in the primary flow. 

.. Configure the step as needed. 

.. Repeat the previous three instructions for each step that you 
want to add to this conditional flow. 

.. In the upper right, click *Back to primary flow*, which saves 
this conditional flow and displays the primary flow. 
+
If the integration executes this conditional flow, after executing 
the steps in this flow, the integration executes the next step in 
the primary flow.  

.. For each conditional flow that you want to create, go back to 
the beginning of step 4 and repeat these instructions. 

.Results
The primary flow has a conditional flow for each condition that you 
defined in the *Conditional Flows* step. If you selected the 
*Use a default flow* option, the primary flow also has a default 
conditional flow. During execution, the *Conditional Flows* step 
executes the conditional flow that is associated with the 
condition that evaluates to true or it evaluates the default 
conditional flow, if there is one, and if no condition evaluates 
to true. After executing a conditional flow, or after no condition 
evaluates to true, the integration continues execution with the 
step that follows the *Conditional Flows* step.
