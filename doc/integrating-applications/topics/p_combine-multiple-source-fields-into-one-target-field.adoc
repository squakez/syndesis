= Combining multiple source fields into one target field

In a data mapper step, you can combine multiple source fields into one 
compound target field. For example, you can map the `FirstName` and `LastName` 
fields to the `CustomerName` field.

.Prerequisite
For the target field, you must know what type of content is in each
part of this compound field, the order and index of each part of the content, 
and the separator between parts, such as a space or comma. See
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#example-missing-unwanted-data_map[Example of missing or unwanted data]. 

.Procedure

. In the *Target* panel, click the field into which you want to map more 
than one source field.

. In the *Sources* panel, if there is a field that contains the fields
that you want to map to the target field, then click that container field 
to map all contained fields to the target field. 
+
To individually select each source field, click the first field that 
you want to combine into the target field. For each of the other fields 
that you want to combine into the target field, hover over that field, and press 
*CTRL-Mouse1* (*CMD-Mouse1* on MacOS).
+
When you are done you should see a line from each of the source fields to
the target field. 

. In the *Mapping Details* panel, in the *Separator* field, accept or select the 
character that the data mapper inserts in the target field between the content
from different source fields. The default is a space.

. In the *Mapping Details* panel, under *Sources*, ensure that the source
fields are in the same order as the corresponding content in the
compound target field. 
+
If necessary, drag and drop source fields to achieve the same order. 
The data mapper automatically updates the index numbers to reflect the 
new order. 

. If you mapped a source field to each part of the compound target field,
then skip to the next step.
+
If the target field expects data that is not available to be mapped, then in the 
*Mapping Details* panel, edit the index of each 
source field so that it is the same as the index of the corresponding data
in the compound target field. The data mapper automatically adds 
padding fields as needed to indicate missing data. 
+
If you accidentally create too many padding fields, click the trash-can 
icon on each extra padding field to delete it.  

. Optionally, preview the data mapping result: 
.. In the upper right of the data mapper, click 
image:shared/images/EditorSettings.png[Editor settings] and select 
*Show Mapping Preview* to display a text input field on each source
field for the currently selected mapping and a read-only result field 
on the target field of the currently selected mapping. 
.. In the source data input fields, enter text. Click outside the
text box to display the mapping result in the read-only field on the target field.
+
If you reorder the source fields or add a transformation to the mapping
then the result field on the target field reflects this. If the data mapper
detects any errors, it displays informative messages at the top of the 
*Mapping Details* panel. 

.. Hide the preview fields by clicking 
image:shared/images/EditorSettings.png[Editor settings] again and selecting
*Show Mapping Preview*. 
+
If you redisplay the preview fields, any data
that you entered in them is still there and it 
remains there until you exit the data mapper. 

. To confirm that the mapping is correctly defined, in the upper right, click
image:shared/images/grid.png[Grid] to display the mappings defined in
this step. A mapping that combines the values of more than one source field
into one target field looks like this:

+
You can also preview mapping results in this view. Click 
image:shared/images/EditorSettings.png[Editor settings], select 
*Show Mapping Preview*, and enter text as described in the previous step.
Preview fields appear for only the selected mapping. Click another
mapping in the table to view preview fields for it.
