= Separating one source field into multiple target fields

In a data mapper step, you can separate a compound source field into multiple
target fields. For  example, map the `Name` field to the `FirstName` and
 `LastName` fields.

.Prerequisite
For the source field, you must know what type of content is in each
part of this compound field, the order and index of each part of the content, 
and the separator between parts, such as a space or comma. See
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#example-missing-unwanted-data_map[Example of missing or unwanted data]. 

.Procedure

. In the *Sources* panel, click the field whose content you want to separate.
. In the *Target* panel, click the first field that you want to separate the
source field data into.
. In the *Target* panel, for each additional target field that you want
to contain some of the data from the source field, hover over the field and 
press *CTRL-Mouse1* (*CMD-Mouse1* on MacOS) to select it.
+
When you are done selecting target fields, you should see lines from the 
source field to each of the target fields. 

. In the *Mapping Details* panel, in the *Separator* field, 
accept or select the character in the source field that indicates 
where to separate the source field values. The default is a space.

. In the *Mapping Details* panel, under *Targets*, ensure that the target
fields are in the same order as the corresponding content in the
compound source field. 
+
If necessary, drag and drop target fields to achieve the same order. 
The data mapper automatically updates the index numbers to reflect the 
new order. 

. If you mapped each part of the compound source field to a target
field, then skip to the next step.
+
If the source field contains data that you do not need, then in the 
*Mapping Details* panel, edit the index of each 
target field so that it is the same as the index of the corresponding data
in the compound source field. The data mapper automatically adds 
padding fields as needed to indicate unwanted data. 

. Optionally, preview the data mapping result: 
.. In the upper right of the data mapper, click 
image:shared/images/EditorSettings.png[Editor settings] and select 
*Show Mapping Preview* to display a text input field on the source
field and read-only result fields on each target field. 
.. In the source field's data input field, enter text. Be sure to enter
the separator character between the parts of the field. Click outside 
the text box to display the mapping result in the read-only fields 
on the target fields.
+
If you reorder the target fields or add a transformation to a target field 
then the result fields on the target fields reflect this. If the data mapper
detects any errors, it displays informative messages at the top of the 
*Mapping Details* panel. 

.. Hide the preview fields by clicking 
image:shared/images/EditorSettings.png[Editor settings] again and selecting
*Show Mapping Preview*. 
+
If you redisplay the preview fields, any data that you entered in them is 
still there and it remains there until you exit the data mapper. 

. To confirm that the mapping is correctly defined, click
image:shared/images/grid.png[Grid] to display the mappings defined in
this step. A mapping that separates the value of a source field into
multiple target fields looks like this:

+
You can also preview mapping results in this view. Click 
image:shared/images/EditorSettings.png[Editor settings], select 
*Show Mapping Preview*, and enter text as described in the previous step.
Preview fields appear for only the selected mapping. Click another
mapping in the table to view preview fields for it.
